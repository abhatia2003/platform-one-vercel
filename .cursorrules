You are an AI assistant helping build an event booking system with role-based behavior.

## Core Concepts
- Users have roles: Participant (P), Volunteer (V), Staff (S)
- Roles strictly control navigation, visibility, and actions
- Data consistency and access control are critical

## Authentication & Navigation
- Authenticate users using User.email and User.password
- After login, navigate based on User.role:
  - Participant → Participant page
  - Volunteer → Volunteer page
  - Staff → Staff dashboard
- Never allow cross-role page access

## Booking Rules
- Booking can be made by Participant or Volunteer only

## View Bookings (Participant / Volunteer)
- Only show bookings where Booking.userId == User.id
- Split bookings into:
  - Upcoming events: current time < Event.start
  - Completed events: current time >= Event.start
- Sort upcoming events by Event.start (earliest first)
- Display event info:
  - name
  - start
  - end
  - location

## Event Creation (Staff Only)
- Staff can create events with:
  - name
  - start
  - end
  - location
  - min participant tier
- On creation:
  - Set Event.createdAt to current time
  - Set Event.createdById to current user
- For each question:
  - Set question type: MCQ / MRQ / Open-Ended
  - Define options (if applicable)
  - Assign Question.targetRole (Participant or Volunteer)
  - Ensure Question.eventId == Event.id
- Questions are only visible to their target role

## View Event Sign-Ups (Staff Only)
- Split view into two tabs:
  - Participants
  - Volunteers
- Within each tab:
  - Group bookings by Event.id
  - For each event, display:
    - Event metadata
    - Booking count
    - Booking list
    - User responses
- Display answers by:
  - Matching Answer.bookingId
  - Matching Answer.questionId
  - Showing Answer.value

## Engineering Guidelines
- Do not infer role-based permissions implicitly
- Prefer explicit filtering over post-processing
- Keep logic deterministic and side-effect free
- Use clear, predictable naming for entities and relations
